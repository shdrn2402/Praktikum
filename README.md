| # | Name and objectives of the project |Project Description | Technology Stack |
|:-:|:-----------------|:---------------|:------------|
| 1 | [SuccessfulGames](https://github.com/shdrn2402/data_analysis/tree/eng/SuccessfullGames) - finding patterns that determine a game's success, using historical data on computer game sales, user and expert evaluations, genres, and platforms. | The parameters determining the success of the game in different regions of the world were revealed. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer games store for planning advertising campaigns. Pre-processing of the data and analysis was carried out. Selected a relevant period for analysis. Portraits of users in each region were compiled. Hypotheses tested: average user ratings of Xbox One and PC platforms are the same and average user ratings of Action and Sports genres are different.|Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing.|
| 2 | [FoodMarket](https://github.com/shdrn2402/data_analysis/tree/eng/FoodMarket) - research on the Moscow catering market in order to make a decision about opening a new establishment.| I researched the question of whether a cafe with robotic waiters will be successful and popular for a long time. Based on the results of the analysis, I prepared a presentation for investors with recommendations.  I also needed to get the location of competing cafes. I solved this problem by connecting to the Google geocode API.| Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, data visualization, Google Geocoding API, API, parsing.|
| 3 | [UsersBehavior](https://github.com/shdrn2402/data_analysis/tree/eng/UsersBehavior) - analysis of user behavior in the mobile app.| In this project I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, investigated the users' path to purchase. I analyzed the results of the A/B-test of the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group It was revealed that the new font would not significantly affect user behavior.| A/B-тестирование, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, event analytics, product metrics, Plotly, statistical hypothesis testing, data visualization.|
| 4 | [ClientsChurn](https://github.com/shdrn2402/data_analysis/tree/eng/ClientsChurn) - predicting the probability of user churn for fitness centers.| Machine learning was used in this project. The probability of churn (at the level of the next month) for each client was predicted; typical portraits of users were formed: the brightest groups were identified, their main properties were characterized; the main attributes that most strongly influence the churn were analyzed.| Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, machine learning, classification, clustering.|
